Framewerk is an build environment.  It aims for repeatability
and extensibility.  Repeatable means that the exact conditions and
business processes under which a piece of software is released can
be recreated.  Extensibility means that business processes regarding
development are packaged and versioned, and modifications take effect
on all projects without requiring those projects to be modified.
In addition, framewerk abstracts around differences such as packaging
format and revision control, easily allowing organizations to experiment
with new development technologies.
